The basic installation procedure is

Download
--------

Download GDAL and the GDAL python bindings. As of this writing the latest versions are:
http://www.gisinternals.com/sdk/Download.aspx?file=release-1600-gdal-mapserver\gdal-110dev-1600-core.msi
http://www.gisinternals.com/sdk/Download.aspx?file=release-1600-gdal-mapserver\GDAL-1.10.0.win32-py2.7.msi

Download the LINZ replication package from github.

Install
-------
Install the GDAL package.
gdal-110dev-1600-core.msi

Then manually add the GDAL install location to the PATH system variable


Open: Control-Panel
Open: System
Select: Advanced
Select: Environment Variables
choose PATH from the 'System variables' selection box and click edit
Add "c:\Program Files\GDAL;" to the Variable value: string. NB. Make this the first entry in the PATH string to bypass previous/bogus installations


Install the Python bindings.
GDAL-1.10.0.win32-py2.7.msi

Unzip the master.zip file to a convenient location
Make a copy of the ldsincr.conf file giving it a meaningful name. This is your user preferences file.
Edit your user preferences file adding your API key and changing other settings to suit your particular environment.

NB. All that is absolutely needed here is an API key and optionally this could be added to the main config file instead 



Test
----
To test whether GDAL has installed correctly open a command prompt and type ogr2ogr. If things have installed correctly you should see the ogr2ogr Usage message returned.
To test whether the LDS replication script works correctly try the commandline "python <path-to>/ldsreplicate.py -h". This should return a Usage message
