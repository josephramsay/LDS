#global variables
#global layer lists for special treatment

#64 bit layers identifies layers containing 64 bit integer fields requiring conversion to a string datatype

64bitlayers: 1203,1204,1205,1209,1028,1029

#Partition Layers. Large layers (records>100,000) are not completely served over WFS. Listing layers below triggers feature-by-feature copying of data blocks delimited by range in the primary key. This is implemeneted in CQL and will typically take the form cql_filter=id between 0 and 9999. Note. Feature-by-feature copys, especially for large layers, will be very slow.

#Temporary Table type. Decide the preferred format for the table where WFS results are stored and manipulated before saving to permanent storage. 
#DIRECT doesn't use a temporary but because DB column deletes temporarily leave data in their respective tables you could end up with a replication database larger than you expected. 
#Memory is the fastest temp table method but requires RAM sufficient to handle the largest layer you want to download. 
#ESRI requires less memory but truncates 'long' column names so would be a problem when adding incremental updates with full column names. 
#Mapinfo, GeoJSON, GMT and AutoCAD DXF all have problems when deleting columns though future updates may change this.
#Currently supported {DIRECT, Memory, ESRI Shapefile, Mapinfo File, GeoJSON, GMT, DXF (AutoCAD DXF)}
